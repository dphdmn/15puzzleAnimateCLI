## 15puzzleAnimateCLI - Animation Tool for Windows CMD (C++)

15puzzleAnimateCLI is a specialized animation tool developed for the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) using C++. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this tool allows you to create engaging animations of the 15 Puzzle concept.

### Requirements

To use 15puzzleAnimateCLI, you must have the "slidycli" library installed. You can find the library and installation instructions at [slidy-cli](https://github.com/benwh1/slidy-cli/releases)

### Usage

To create captivating animations with 15puzzleAnimateCLI, follow these steps:

0. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

1. Compile the tool by running `compile.bat` from `colortest.cpp`, or simply download `core.exe` if you prefer the precompiled version.

2. **Windows Only:** Please note that 15puzzleAnimateCLI has been tailored specifically for Windows and might not be compatible with other operating systems.

3. Now, you can create an animation using the following example command:


   ```
   animate "10 7 6 11/1 3 12 5/4 13 14 2/9 0 15 8" "DLDLDRRUURULLDRDLULDDRRRULDLUULURRDDLLDRRULLUU"
   ```

   This example command will animate the 15 puzzle with the initial configuration `10 7 6 11/1 3 12 5/4 13 14 2/9 0 15 8`, following the sequence of movements provided in the second argument `DLDLDRRUURULLDRDLULDDRRRULDLUULURRDDLLDRRULLUU`.

Please ensure that the input format for the 15 puzzle configuration is correct, with numbers separated by spaces and each row separated by a forward slash. The movement sequence should consist of characters 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right) to represent the sliding direction of the tile.

Now you can animate your own 15 puzzles using 15puzzleAnimateCLI on Windows CMD! üéÆüñ•Ô∏è
