## 15puzzleAnimateCLI - Animation Tool for Windows CMD (C++)

15puzzleAnimateCLI is a specialized animation tool developed for the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) using C++. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this tool allows you to create captivating animations of the 15 Puzzle concept within the Windows CMD window.

**Please Note:** The animations created with 15puzzleAnimateCLI are designed to be displayed solely within the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) environment and do not generate any standalone animation files.

### Requirements

Before using 15puzzleAnimateCLI, make sure to have the "slidycli" library installed. You can find the library and installation instructions at [slidy-cli](https://github.com/benwh1/slidy-cli/releases).

### Usage

Follow these steps to create your 15 Puzzle animations:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the tool by running `compile.bat` from `colortest.cpp`, or simply download `core.exe` if you prefer the precompiled version.

3. Now, you can create an animation using the following example command:

   ```
   animate "10 7 6 11/1 3 12 5/4 13 14 2/9 0 15 8" "DLDLDRRUURULLDRDLULDDRRRULDLUULURRDDLLDRRULLUU"
   ```

   This command will animate the 15 Puzzle with the initial configuration `10 7 6 11/1 3 12 5/4 13 14 2/9 0 15 8`, following the sequence of movements provided in the second argument `DLDLDRRUURULLDRDLULDDRRRULDLUULURRDDLLDRRULLUU`.

   Ensure that the input format for the 15 Puzzle configuration is correct, with numbers separated by spaces, and each row separated by a forward slash. The movement sequence should consist of characters 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right) to represent the sliding direction of the tile.
